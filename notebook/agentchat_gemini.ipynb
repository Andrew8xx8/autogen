    "# Using Gemini in AutoGen with Other LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this PR is still not merged into the main branch, you need to run the following setup to install AutoGen with Gemini features.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/archive/gemini.zip\n",
    "pip install \"google-generativeai\" \"pillow\" \"pydantic==1.10.13\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "You don't need to handle OpenAI or Google's GenAI packages. AutoGen already handled all of these for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can just create different agents with different backend LLM with assistant agent, and all models/agents are at your fingertip.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Distinctions\n",
    "- Gemini does not have the \"system_message\" field (correct me if I am wrong). So, it's instruction following skills are not as strong as GPTs.\n"

      "\n",
      "**Problem:** Vision disabilities limit an individual's ability to interpret visual information and interact with the physical world.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Product Idea:** A multimodal product that leverages AI and sensory feedback to enhance the user's experience and empower them to navigate their surroundings confidently.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pipeline:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Image Acquisition and Processing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The product features a camera that captures images of the environment.\n",
      "* These images are processed to enhance clarity and reduce noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Object Detection and Description:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The processed images are fed into a Gemini model, a deep learning model trained on a vast dataset of images.\n",
      "* The model identifies and labels objects within the image, providing a textual description of each object.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Spatial Localization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Advanced image segmentation techniques are employed to determine the location of each object within the image.\n",
      "* This location information is translated into spatial feedback using haptic or auditory cues.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Multimodal Feedback:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Haptic Feedback:** Small vibrations or tactile cues are generated to indicate the presence and location of objects. For example, if a user is facing a door, the device could vibrate on the left side to signal its position.\n",
      "* **Auditory Feedback:** A synthesized voice provides a detailed description of the image, including the objects present and their locations. This information can be relayed through headphones or a speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Product Implementation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Wearable Device:** The product is designed as a wearable device, such as a wristband or headset. It is lightweight and easy to carry around.\n",
      "* **Intuitive User Interface:** The device has an intuitive user interface that allows the user to easily control the settings and receive feedback.\n",
      "* **Customization:** Users can customize the feedback modalities to suit their individual preferences and needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improved Spatial Awareness:** The device enhances the user's spatial awareness by providing real-time information about their surroundings.\n",
      "* **Increased Confidence:** Accurate and detailed feedback empowers users to navigate their surroundings with confidence.\n",
      "* **Accessibility:** The multimodal approach caters to the different sensory needs of users with varying degrees of vision impairment.\n",
      "* **Empowerment:** The device fosters independence and self-reliance by enabling users to engage with their environment more effectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Object Recognition Training:** The device can be trained to recognize specific objects that are particularly relevant to the user. For example, a user could train the device to identify their home address or the entrance to their workplace.\n",
      "* **Obstacle Detection:** In addition to object recognition, the device can also be used to detect obstacles in the user's path. This can help prevent accidents and improve safety.\n",
      "* **Wayfinding Assistance:** The device can provide turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to specific destinations. This feature can be particularly useful in unfamiliar environments.\n",
      "* **Social Interaction:** The device can be integrated with social media platforms to allow users to share their experiences and connect with others who have similar challenges.\n",
      "* **Privacy and Security:** The device should adhere to strict privacy and security standards to protect the user's personal information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Target Audience:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Individuals with low vision or blindness\n",
      "* Seniors with age-related vision impairment\n",
      "* People with cognitive disabilities that affect visual processing\n",
      "\n",
      "**Product Impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This multimodal product has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for people with vision disabilities.
